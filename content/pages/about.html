<p class="p1">smARTLab (swarms, multi-Agent, Robot Technology, and Learning lab) is a state-of-the-art robotics
    laboratory at the Department of Computer Science, University of Liverpool.&nbsp;&nbsp;The lab is affiliated with the
    University’s <a href="https://www.liv.ac.uk/autonomous-systems/">Centre for Autonomous Systems Technology (CAST)</a>.
    The smARTLab team have been dedicated to the research in robot perception with vision and tactile sensing, and
    learning technologies (both single and multi-agent), with applications to robot grasping and manipulation.</p>
<p class="p1">smARTLab includes two large experimentation facilities (approximately 60 square meters each), of which one
    has high ceilings (about 4 meters) for experimentation with UAVs (but also UGVs). The lab hosts £400k of specialist
    facilities including: two collaborative (UR5) robot arms, four state-of-the-art 2/3-finger robot grippers, 10 Parrot
    Bebop 2 drones, 10 CrazyFlie nanocopters, 20 e-puck robots, 30 Turtlebot II robots, an octocopter, three KUKA
    youBots, an Optitrack motion capturing system, and a fleet of small robots. Check out our robot members <a
            href="https://smartlab.csc.liv.ac.uk/robots/">here</a>! The lab also includes computational facilities (both
    CPU and GPU servers) and two hardware workbenches. Feel free to step in and have a look.</p>
<p class="p1">The smARTLab team won the 2014 RoboCup@work and RoCKIn2015@work competitions. Check out our achievements
    <a href="https://smartlab.csc.liv.ac.uk/smartlabatwork/">here</a>!</p>
<p class="p1">The laboratory will be a key element of the University’s new <a
        href="https://news.liverpool.ac.uk/2018/11/02/plans-for-new-digital-innovation-factory-approved/">Digital
    Innovation Facility (DIF)</a> that will open in 2021. The DIF is a new £12M building and will bring together
    complementary areas of research in computer science, robotics and engineering. It will become a centre of excellence
    in autonomous systems, distributed simulation and immersive visualisation, enabling collaborative R&amp;D and
    supporting industry linked to the exploitation of digital technologies.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The lab is led by <a href="https://cgi.csc.liv.ac.uk/~shanluo/">Dr. Shan Luo</a>. Check
