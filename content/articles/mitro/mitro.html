<p>MITRO is the Mersey (formerly Maastricht) Intelligent Telepresence Robot, also known as Bob. The aim of the MITRO
    project is to develop a telepresence robot, allowing the user to be present in a remote location while
    maintaining mobility. We go beyond traditional telepresence robotics by bestowing the robot with intelligence, e.g.
    autonomous localisation and navigation, obstacle detection and avoidance, and people recognition and tracking.</p>
<p>An example application is to remotely monitor and guide a swarm of robots in an exploration setting, see Figure.
    Here, the remote user can guide the swarm to explore specific parts of the environment, even when the swarm is
    capable of local communication only.</p>
