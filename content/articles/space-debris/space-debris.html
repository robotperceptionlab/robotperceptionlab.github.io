<p>This project was a partnership with the
    <a href="http://www.esa.int/gsp/ACT/ai/projects/gt_debris.html"
       target="_blank" rel="noopener">Advanced Concepts Team</a> of the European
    Space Agency under the Ariadna framework.</p>
<p>The study aimed to analyse space debris removal efforts from a strategic, game-theoretical perspective. The objective
    was three-fold, one, to model debris accumulation and active removal efforts as a dynamic game, two, to determine
    the optimal time-dependent policies or behaviour assuming both cooperative and self-interested players, and three,
    to propose a mechanism to steer the dynamics of the game to a desirable outcome. It was expected that such a study
    would provide a deeper understanding of the space debris problem and its potential (economic) ramifications, and an
    outlook on potential game-theoretic solution strategies.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Space debris is defined as non-manoeuvrable, human-made objects orbiting Earth. Space
    debris poses a significant collision risk for an operational spacecraft, especially in low-Earth orbit (LEO). At
    typical relative velocities of 10km/s, a collision with a piece of space debris of about 10cm in diameter is
    expected to cause a disintegration of the spacecraft. This breakup causes a large number of fragments and the higher
    density of debris increases the risk of collision further. The build-up of space debris eventually results in a
    catastrophic cascade of collisions, also called the Kessler syndrome. Currently, there are more than 23,000 objects
    larger than 5-10cm in Earth orbit (see figure).</p>
<p>Within the Clean Space initiative ESA is investigating active debris removal in addition to mitigation measures to
    keep the growth of space debris limited. In cooperation with the national space agencies and industry partners, ESA
    is developing mission concepts to clean up and deorbit space debris. In addition to a number of complex technical
    challenges, active debris removal is a very costly undertaking.</p>
<p>Due to the risk of a collision cascading, measures taken early on are desirable. As space agencies, as well as
    commercial players, have an interest to launch more and more satellites over the next decades, the necessity for
    active removal is growing and at some point will be imminent to secure operational safety for current and future
    missions. An active debris removal mission will have a positive effect (or risk reduction) for all satellites in the
    same orbital band. This leads to a dilemma: every player has an incentive to delay its actions and wait for others
    to respond. Each player is faced with the decision between acting now or postponing to take action, i.e., either
    take an individually costly action of debris removal, which has a positive impact on all players; or wait until
    others jump in and do the ‘dirty’ work, as this will be at their own benefit and reduce their own costs. The risk of
    the latter action is that if everyone waits the joint outcome will be catastrophic leading to what in game theory is
    referred to as the ‘tragedy of the commons’.</p>
