<p>The Chemistry Lab of the Future project aims to bring Industry 4.0 to todayâ€™s chemistry labs. In this project, AI and
    robotics researchers of the smARTLab collaborate with chemists from the Liverpool University <a
            href="https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/chemistry/">Department of Chemistry</a>, more specifically, the <a
            href="https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/cooper-group/">Cooper Group</a>. The goal of this research is to enable
    researchers to perform more extensive series of experiments by robotic automation, yet instead of relying on bulky
    and expensive stationary hardware, mobile robots should interconnect already existing laboratory equipment and
    integrate seamlessly with their human colleagues.</p>

<p>In many industries, laboratories have started to incorporate robotic systems in their day-to-day workflows. Compared
    to conventional chemistry labs, we wish to improve throughput and reproducibility for the Chemistry Lab of the
    Future. Concerning throughput, there are natural limits a single robot has to succumb to, as it can not be present
    in multiple locations at the same time. In order to truly excel in outperforming a human-operated lab, multiple
    cooperating robots are required. The quality of coordination and synchronization is key for the Chemistry Lab of the
    Future to be able to scale according to demand, as more robots can produce more potential conflicts. Regarding
    reproducibility, the robot has to be able to detect potential impurities or disturbances of the workflow. Using
    advanced machine learning and vision techniques, these requirements shall be met. Recently in the field of computer
    vision, deep&nbsp; convolutional neural networks have shown their potential. Detailed structural information about
    chemical apparatus may be obtained by 3D laser scanners. This information can be further used to plan robotic arm
    trajectories to reach into appliances without collision.</p>
